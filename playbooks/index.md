The enclosed playbooks are contributed by multiple Consortium members and reflect the practices of those individual Dojos. They are all wrong in some way, but are the best practices we know currently.

Playbooks are focused documents that can be used as a reference by teams wanting to improve how they perform an activity or those helping to coach teams. Each playbook is focused on a single pain point or practice.

## Recommended Practices

A playbook should follow the following structure:

- Definition of what the playbook is trying to accomplish.
- A label of the target audience
- Recommended, actionable practices that have been found effective.
- Tips and tricks that have been found useful in the past.

### Tips

Keep the playbook short enough that it can be consumed quickly. Think 5 minute read, not a novella. Slice if required.
