# {{ page.title }}

Throughput per week. This is measured by how many
items were finished as a trend over time. This includes all items,
defects and story work.

### What is the intended behavior?

Help teams find what level of throughput per week is consistently achievable and find ways to increase this over time by reducing waste, reducing toil, improving planning, and focusing on teamwork.

### How is it improved?

- Smaller stories are easier to understand and deliver.
- Minimize hard dependencies. Each hard dependency reduces the odds of on-time
  delivery by 50%.
- Swarm stories so that the team is working as a unit to deliver faster.

### How is it gamed?

- More, smaller tasks.
- Cherry pick easy, low priority items.
- Skip quality steps.
- Prematurely sign-off work only to have defects reported later.

### When over-driven, what metrics are impacted?

- [Quality](./quality.html) defect ratio goes up as more defects are reported.
- [WIP](./work-in-progress.html) increases as teams start more work to look more
  busy.
