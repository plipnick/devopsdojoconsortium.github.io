This shows the average time it takes for a new request to be delivered. This is
measured from the creation date to release date for each unit of work and includes [Development Cycle Time](./development-cycle-time.html).

### What is the intended behavior?

Identify over utilized teams, backlogs that need more Product Owner attention,
or in conjunction with [productivity](./productivity.html) to help teams optimize their processes.

### How is it improved?

Relentlessly remove old items from the backlog.
Improve team processes to reduce [Development Cycle Time](./development-cycle-time.html).
Use Innersourcing to allow other teams to help when surges of work arrive.
Re-assign, carefully, some components to another team to scale delivery.

### How is it gamed?

- Requests can be tracked in spreadsheet or other locations and then added to
  the backlog just before development. This can be identified by decreased
  customer satisfaction.
- Reduce feature refining rigour.

### When over-driven, what metrics are impacted?

- [Quality](./quality.html) is reduced as less time is spent refining and defining
  how to validate the feature.
- [Productivity](./productivity.html) is reduced if tightly coupled components are
  shifted to another team or excessive communication is required for
